# Selm
Selm is the Cmd framework liked the Elm Cmd.

I call an architecture pattern using Selm 'Selm architecture pattern'. Because Selm doesn't have a virtual DOM system. Selm is 'Sham Elm'.

And Selm architecture pattern is incomplete. It isn't polished to handle wireframes and views. I need someone's help.

## Sample
